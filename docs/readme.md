# unity perlin noise
## about
* noise exploration but mostly perlin noise in unity
* starting with white noise so we have some frame of reference
## TODO
- [x] simple scene layout
- [x] swapping between shaders UI
- [x] copying across white noise shaders
- [x] simple grid uv shader
- [x] grabbing bottom left pixel for each cell sourcing value from input noise
    * we realised we needed to check our input texture was ready before we try to use it, otherwise it might not be
- [x] verify textures are starting from bottom left
- [ ] swapping between scenes
